# Chrome Web Store Listing: WiseShield - Phishing Protection

## Summary
WiseShield is an AI-powered phishing protection extension that keeps you safe from malicious websites and credential harvesting in real-time.

## Description
Stop phishing before it starts. WiseShield uses a hybrid detection engine combining real-time heuristics and advanced Machine Learning to analyze URLs and page content, identifying threats that traditional blocklists miss.

### Key Features:
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Real-time classification of URLs using a state-of-the-art ML model.
- **Explainable Security**: Don't just get blocked—understand why a site is suspicious with detailed risk factors.
- **Form Protection**: Detects credential harvesting fields on suspicious pages.
- **Zero-Trust Heuristics**: Multi-layered analysis covering URL patterns, TLD reputation, and social engineering language.
- **Privacy First**: We only analyze URLs for security purposes. No browsing history is tracked or sold.

### Why WiseShield?
Phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated, bypassing standard browser protections. WiseShield adds an intelligent safety layer that watches your back while you browse.
